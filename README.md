# Market Tracker

## The Project

This project was designed as a way for user to be able to query historical data on different stocks and then add "shares" in these stocks to different dummy portfolios in order to track trends, categories or anything else they can think of. Other features include:

-   Third party Api providing real data on over 20,000 US listed stocks.
-   Partially mobile responsive.
-   JWT authentification.
